I noticed a lot of us were redoing work already done before, hoping this ends up being a unified place for flag colors :3

# contributing
## preferred naming format
- popular name is preferred, like 'ace' for asexual
- 'gender' is implied, e.g 'voidgender' -> 'void'
- have -gender or -sexual? shorten to `-gen` and `-sex`, e.g `bigender` -> `bigen`
- multiple flags for a group have a number appended to them, e.g `gay`, `gay2`
- other than that, shortenings are to your liking
## weights
- only needed on flags with stripes of different sizes, like `inter` and `progress`
- should be reduced by their greatest common factor

# todo
- create packages for easier use? seems to be the easiest option for everyone
- spit output onto its own branch?
- poke more owners of other pride tools
