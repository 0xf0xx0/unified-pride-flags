I noticed a lot of us were redoing work already done before, hoping this ends up being a unified place for flag colors :3

# preferred naming format
- popular name is preferred, like 'ace' for asexual
- 'gender' is implied, e.g 'voidgender' -> 'void'
- have -gender or -sexual? shorten to `-gen` and `-sex`, e.g `bigender` -> `bigen`
- multiple flags for a group have a number appended to them, e.g `gay`, `gay2`
- other than that, shortenings are to your liking

# sources
## general
- https://flag.library.lgbt/hashtags/
- https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/
- https://gender.fandom.com/
- https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/flags/pride - seems to contain troll flags? :\
## specific
- abrosexual - colorpicked - https://web.archive.org/web/20240428162324/https://fyeahaltpride.tumblr.com/post/151704251345/could-you-guys-possibly-make-an-abrosexual-pride

# todo
- use plain json only? provide different formats like yaml and toml?
- poke more owners of other pride tools
